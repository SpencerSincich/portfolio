		<h4>
			Software development tools
		</h4>

			<br>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			A <strong>software development tool</strong> is a type of software used by a developer to create new and improve existing software. For this article, <strong>software</strong> is defined as a set of electronic instructions that tell the <strong>hardware</strong> (physical components of the computer) what tasks to perform.
		</p>

			<br>

			<br>

		<h4>
			Source code editors 
		</h4>

			<br>

			<br>


		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			A <strong>source code editor</strong> is software used by a developer to type text instructions in a <strong>high-level programming language</strong>. This is a source language that is easiest for a developer to describe instructions in, such as C, C++, Java, PHP, Python, Visual Basic, etc.
		</p>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			The instructions the developer types in the source code editor are like the first steps of a cake recipe being precisely followed. Everything is prepared before the step of putting the ingredients in the oven.
		</p>

			<br>

			<br>

		<h4>
			Compilers and interpreters
		</h4>

			<br>

			<br>


		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			Both <strong>compilers</strong> and <strong>interpreters</strong> are software development tools used to translate the instructions typed in the source code editor. The instructions are translated from a high-level language to a target language that is, or is closer to, <strong>machine code</strong>. This is a language that hardware understands and uses to perform tasks.
		</p>

			<br>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			A <strong>compiler</strong> translates the entire set of instructions at once, before runtime. So the pre-translated instructions are ready for use in the target language.			
		</p>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			An <strong>interpreter</strong> translates the specified subset of instructions at runtime. So the subset of instructions are translated to the target language only when required.
		</p>

			<br>

			<br>


		<h4>
			Reasons for using compilers and/or interpreters
		</h4>

			<br>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			For most practical purposes, each programming language is usually considered either a compiled or an interpreted language. However, in some scenarios, developers can use a compiler and/or interpreter to translate code from the same source language
		</p>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			What remains the same is: For the instructions to work on hardware, the source code must eventually be translated to machine code.
		</p>

			<br>

			<br>

		<ul>The developer's decision to use a compiler and/or interpreter is based on weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each process. The decisive criteria is usually:

			<li>
				<strong>Portability</strong> - Which machines will the software work on?
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Performance</strong> - What will optimize the speed of the software?
			</li>

		</ul>

			<br>

		<blockquote>
			Compiled instructions have low portability, and are high performance.
		</blockquote>

			<br>

		<p class="tabLeft">
			For example: A developer types source code in C that is compiled into machine code.
		</p>

			<br>


		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			The <strong>disadvantage of compiling instructions</strong> is the compiled code has <strong>low portability</strong>. This means the instructions can work on fewer types of hardware.
		</p>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			The <strong>advantage of compiling instructions</strong> is the compiled code is <strong>high performance</strong>. This means the instructions work faster.
		</p>


			<br>


		<blockquote>
			Interpreted instructions have high portability, and are low performance.
		</blockquote>

			<br>

		<p class="tabLeft">
			For example: A developer types source code in PHP that is interpreted into machine code.
		</p>

			<br>


		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			The <strong>advantage of interpreting instructions</strong> is  the source code has <strong>high portability</strong>. This means the same PHP code can work on many types of hardware — with the help of interpreters.	
		</p>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			The <strong>disadvantage of interpreting instructions</strong> is the interpreted code is <strong>low performance</strong>. This means the instructions work slower, because of the required interpretation step. However, the interpreted code is still fast enough for most purposes.
		</p>

			<br>

			<br>


		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			A more complex process occurs when developers type source code in Java, and use <strong>both a compiler and an interpreter</strong> to translate the code.
		</p>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			First the Java source code is compiled into an intermediate language that is a type of machine code, called "bytecode". This code is then executed by an interpreter called the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
		</p>

			<br>


		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			By using both a compiler and an interpreter to translate the Java source code, developers can gain the advantages of using each. They can also minimize the disadvantages.
		</p>

			<br>

			<br>

		<h4>
			Conclusion	
		</h4>

			<br>

			<br>

		<p class="innerPageParagraph">
			The purpose of software development tools is to provide developers with what's necessary to create new and improve existing software. While 3 software development tools are described here, there are many others, such as debuggers, profilers, linkers, etc. For some programming purposes, there is a trend towards the use of <strong>IDEs</strong> (integrated development environments). IDEs include several software development tools in one software product.
